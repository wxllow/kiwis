# Configuring your site

In your newly created site directory, you will have a `site.toml` file which contains all the configuration for your site.

It will look something like this by default:

```toml
name = "My Site"
```

## Site information

```yaml
name: The name of your site.
slogan: A short description of your site.
```

## Plugins

Here you can define plugins

```toml
plugins = []
```

Cocoa includes some great plugins by default, such as `minify`, `typescript`, and `sitemap`.

You can include those like so:

```toml
plugins = [
    "cocoa.plugins.minify", # Minify HTML/CSS/JS
    "cocoa.plugins.typescript", # Typescript support
    "cocoa.plugins.sitemap" # Generate sitemap
]
```

Make sure you only include plugins that you will use, otherwise your site will be slow to build and/or load.
