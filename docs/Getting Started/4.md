# Creating pages

Pages can be created many different ways. You can use Markdown, Plain HTML, Jinja, and you can use plugins for even more functionality. For this tutorial, we will make our site using Jinja templates and Markdown.

## Base Template

One of the powers of Jinja is that you can create reusable templates.

In cocoa, the default name of the base template is `_base.jinja` or `_base.html`. This will also be used for your Markdown files if you don't specify a different template. (Which you can do so by making a `_markdown.jinja` or `_markdown.html` file.)

Let's make a simple base template.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Site</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css">
    <!-- We can use this in other pages to insert extra HTML into the head -->
    {% block head %}{% endblock %}
</head>
<body>
    <!-- 
    This is where our main content will go. 
    Make sure to keep this named "content" if you want it to work with Markdown files 
    -->
    {% block content %}{% endblock %} 
</body>
</html>

```

## Use the template

Now that we have a base template, we can use it to create our homepage.

```html
{% extends "_base.jinja" %}

{% block head %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/index.css">
    <title>Homepage</title>
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
{% endblock %}
```

## Make a Markdowns file

Let's make an about page, but with Markdown.

```md
# About

This is an about me page.
```
